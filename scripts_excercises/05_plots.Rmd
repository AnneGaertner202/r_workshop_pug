## Now for some fun

There is more to be said about data wrangling, and we will get back to it, but I want to create some plots first.
Plots are fun because they give you nice and colourful results, and they are a very important tool for inspecting your data and getting an intuition for it.
While base `R` has a plotting function, the `tidyverse`'s `ggplot2` is what is partly responsible fpr `R`'s fame.

`ggplot2` is based on the ["Grammar of Graphics" by Leland] Wilkinson(https://www.springer.com/de/book/9780387245447), a framework for good data visualisation in data science.
In a way, `ggplot2` has a grammar of its own, which is something new for us.
But don't worry, it all makes sense.

TO DO: Preprocessing file with the nerd data.
