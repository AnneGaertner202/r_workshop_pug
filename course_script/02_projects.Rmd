# Creating an R project

## Find a place for your R stuff

You want to be able to easily find your code on your computer.
It sounds trivial, but you should have a folder for every project that you do.
And by "project" I don't necessarily mean a full-blown scientific project - it might just be some lines of code that you want to try out.
For example, I have a little project that is called *toying_around*, where I save little bits and pieces of code that I've tried out and that don't really belong anywhere.

You could create a folder named *my_r_projects* on your computer where you store all your `R` projects.
Get used to avoiding spaces or any other "funny characters" in your folder names (e.g. German "Umlaute").
We want to open these folders using `R`, using machine-readable commands.
And machines are really bad at reading things that contain spaces or any other unexpected characters.

This folder will be filled with all your `R` projects.
You might prefer a different structure, that is completely up to you.
However, you need to make a decision about where to put your future `R` projects - and our workshop will be one of these projects.

By the way, you can find amazing tips for folder structure, file naming and `R` project management in these slides by [Danielle Navarro](https://slides.djnavarro.net/project-structure/#1).

## Create your first project

After you decided where you want to put your `R` stuff, we should create our first project for our `R` workshop.
We want to use version control (time travel) throughout this workshop, because I want you to get used to it right from the beginning, so we will first create a new repository on GitHub.[^github_order]
Everything you do will be backed up there and you will always be able to restore previous versions of your script.
It is also a great way of tracking how much you actually achieved within these two days!

### Create e repository on GitHub

Log in to GitHub and create a new repository with the big green "new" button.

[^github_order]: People prefer many different workflows, and you could e.g. create a folder first and create the corresponding repository **afterwards**. Personally, I think starting with a repository is the easiest way, and also the only way that I will teach you, because I want to keep things consistent throughout this workshop.

```{r out.width='50%', fig.cap='Somewhere on GitHub, there should be a big green button that lets you create a new repository.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/new_repo.png")
```

Choose a name for your repository, e.g. *pug_2021_r_workshop*.
You can also provide a short description for your repository, e.g. something like "This repository contains my coding exercises at the PuG 2021 R workshop."
Your repository can be private, which means only you will be able to see it, or public, which means everyone will be able to see it.
If you make it public, it will be much easier for me and other participants of the workshop to collaborate with you, but of course, the decision is up to you.
You can add a **README** file - this file will be shown at the front page of your repository, providing information to everyone visiting.
By default, it will contain your repository's title and the description from above (if you made one).
You can also add a **gitignore** - this is a very useful thing to have because it determines what you want to be on GitHub - and what not.
You might e.g. want to tell GitHub that it should ignore the raw data file in your project, because you don't want to upload any sensitive data or simply because the file is too large to be uploaded.
If you tick the gitignore box, you can use a gitignore template that has some default settings for `R` - just select `R` from the dropdown list.
Lastly, you can set a licence that determines if and how other people can use your code.
You can read up about what those licences mean later, but for our workshop, we won't use any.
Great, now hit that create button!

```{r out.width='80%', fig.cap='These are the options we use when creating a new repository for this workshop.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/create_repo.png")
```

### Pull the repository

You created a repository on GitHub, but we also need a corresponding folder on your computer.
The logic is the following: You have a folder on your computer that is linked to the repository you just created.
When something in the folder on your computer changes, you can update the online repository so it also contains those changes (and vice versa).
It is a bit like a dropbox or a cloud that syncs the files on your computer with some online storage.
Here, the synchronisation will not happen automatically - you choose what to update and what not.

Let's get your repository to your computer.
In RStudio, go to **File** $\to$ **New Project ...** and this is what you should see:

```{r out.width='80%', fig.cap='When creating a project in RStudio, you have different options. You can create a new directory (a new folder) on your computer, put the project into an existing one, or create a project that uses version control. We want to do the latter.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/new_project.png")
```

We want to use GitHub, which is, as you know, a form of **version control**.
So this is what we'll pick.
Next, choose **Git**.
RStudio will then ask you for a repository URL and where to save the repository on your computer.
Just put in the link to your repository (copy it from your browser) - `R` will then detect the repository name and use that name for the corresponding folder on your computer.
You can of course change that name, but I strongly advise not to do that, because it will lead to **A LOT** of confusion.
Lastly, `R` asks you in which folder your new repository folder should be saved.
In my case, this folder is called *r_stuff*, because this is where all my `R` stuff is saved.
(You might have created a folder called *my_r_projects* earlier.)

```{r out.width='80%', fig.cap='Copy the link to your repository.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/repo_link.png")
```

```{r out.width='70%', fig.cap='I pasted the link to my repository into the first text box and R automatically detected the name of the repository (pug_2021_r_workshop). I chose to save the repository in the folder where I keep all my R projects, which is called r_stuff in my case.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/create_git_project.png")
```

You should now find that RStudio created a folder with the same name as your repository in at the place where you told it to put it.

```{r out.width='80%', fig.cap='As intended, R created a folder with the repository name (pug_2021_r_workshop) in my folder r_stuff.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/repo_folder_created.png")
```

Look inside.
The folder contains a gitignore and a README file - no surprise, we created those when we created the repository.
But there is also an `R` project file.

```{r out.width='60%', fig.cap='The repository folder contains the README and the gitignore files that we created when creating the repository. It also contains an R project file with the file ending .Rproj'}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/repo_content.png")
```

## Project-oriented workflow

Those projects are really useful and we will always use them throughout this workshop.
To see how projects work and why they are so powerful, we create a little `R` script first.
If RStudio did not open a script for you already, do so with **File** $\to$ **New File** $\to$ **R Script**.
For now, just type "Hello world"[^hello_world] into the script and save it by clicking the little save icon.

[^hello_world]: Why ["Hello world"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), you ask?

Check your folder again.
You will notice that your script was automatically saved there.
This is because when using a project, you will always be in the location where your project file lies.
It basically works like the "you are here" icon on a map.
It is quite handy that we don't have to look for the correct folder every time we create and save a new script.

However, your script is now probably named *Untitled1.R*. This is not a good name because you don't really know what it contains.
We should have saved it using **File** $\to$ **Save as ...** (maybe under the name *hello_world.R*), but we can just rename it by clicking **File** $\to$ **Rename**.
**Close RStudio for now.**

Head back to your project folder and double click on the Rproject file belonging to your project.
RStudio should open and you will notice that once again, you are in your project folder that contains the script you created earlier.
There should be a **Files** panel in your RStudio where you can see everything that your project folder contains.

```{r out.width='80%', fig.cap='The files pane shows you the files that are in your current "location", which is usually where your project lies. You can also browser other folders and files using the files pane directly within RStudio.'}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/files.png")
```

## Why projects?

You already saw that projects neatly organise your work and come with some handy features, but this is not even the best thing about them.
Briefly, a project-oriented workflow is so powerful because every project is its own little container that can easily be shared.
Everything is relative to the project file, i.e. the "you are here" file.
That means anyone can copy your folder and use it on their computer, even though all of their folder names are different.
Imagine you are standing in front of a city map.
Your friend has a map as well, but all of the streets have different names.
You want to tell your friend how to get to the station.
If you say something like "Go to Wickham Street and then turn left into Burns Street", that won't work, because on your friend's map, these names don't exist.
However, if you tell her "Walk to the end of the street, turn left and walk until you've reached the third tree on your right", that will work, because you're only using relative cues in your friend's environment.

That means that projects make it easier to share code with other people, which is important for reproducibility.
This was merely the gist of it; we will learn more about these concepts throughout the workshop.
