# Installation Guide

Hello and welcome to the introductory `R` course at the PuG 2021!
Before the actual workshops starts, I would like you to set up a few things on your computer.
I would like to spend as much time as possible with actual coding during the workshop, and since installing things always takes up a bit of time, we'll frontload that bit.
Think of it as your personal Hogwarts shopping list - you have to get your robes and your books and your wand and stuff so you'll be all set to do the real magic once you arrive in Hogwarts.

## Every computer is different

That being said, you all have different setups.
You have different computers with different operating systems, and I cannot foresee every little thing that might possibly go wrong when you're installing everything on your side.
But no worries, that's all part of the process.
Should you get stuck at some point, don't hesitate to shoot me an email.
So far, I've got `R` running on any computer - I won't give in to yours ;-)
(That being said, my installation guide is written from a Windows 10 perspective.)

You will sometimes hear that people don't like installing `R` (or any other programming language, for that matter) and dread updating it even more.
I'm here to tell you that it's not that bad at all.
In fact, just stripped my computer of every single programme I normally use in my everyday `R`-related workflow so I can go through the setup with you.
That should show you that there is no need to worry too much about installing or un-installing your `R`-stuff on your computer.
You can't break anything (nothing that can't be fixed, at least).

## The Wand - R

We'll get our wand (`R`) first, because this is what we need to be able to do magic.
You can download it at [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).
Right on the start page, you can find a download link via CRAN ("The Comprehensive R Archive Network").

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/download_r.png")
```

When clicking it, you will be asked to choose a CRAN mirror.
That sounds a bit obscure.
Simply put, the those "mirrors" around the world are servers containing identical information, in this case, the source code, additional packages and all the documentation of R.
The advantage is that you can choose a server near your location for better bandwidth, and also, you will always be able to download R, even when one of the servers should be down.
Personally, I am convinced it is an actual network of magical mirrors in a fantasy world that act as gateways which can transmit R packages between worlds – and no one has proven me wrong yet.
Just pick one near you (anywhere in Germany is perfectly fine) and then download R for your operating system on the next page.
What you want is "base `R`".

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./pics/base.png")
```

Download R and execute the installation file. At this point, it is perfectly fine to just click through everything (unless you have different preferences at some point of the procedure).
If you have windows, it is a good idea to install Rtools as well (mac OS users don’t need it, because your operating system should cover the functionalities Rtools adds on Windows). It is not crucial, so feel free to skip this step. Briefly, Rtools provides tools that are needed on Windows if you want to build R packages. Most of the time, you just download and install the package from CRAN, where you get the “binary version” of a package that is ready to be used on your operating system. Sometimes, for some reason, the latest version of a package is not provided as a binary (yet); maybe because it’s just a few days old. In this case, R will ask you whether it should “compile” the package from source, i.e. build it on your computer. For this job, Rtools is needed on windows. However, you also have the option not to compile the package and get a (slightly) older version of the package. Which is completely fine – if you don’t want to install Rtools, just hit “no” whenever R asks you whether it should compile a package from source. From time to time, R might throw a warning that Rtools is missing, but you can just ignore that.
If you want to have the option to compile packages and e.g. build packages on your own at some point, you can install Rtools. It can again be found on the download page just where we found base R. Only this time, we pick Rtools. It is quite likely that you want the 64 bit version. Execute the installation file and just click through.
RStudio
TO DO: For programming languages, we need an editor … features like saving files etc.
You want to choose the free version of RStudio Desktop: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
Execute the installation file – again, you can just click through.
Git
TO DO: Describe git … version control, blab la
Download git at https://git-scm.com/downloads
Again, you can just click through. TO DO: Explain


```{r child = "02_projects.Rmd", echo = FALSE}
```
