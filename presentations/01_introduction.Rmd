## R is quirky
- INSERT HEX STICKER PIC HERE
- R is developing rapidly.
- It's open source and there are tons of additional packages you can use.
- You have to manage your "dependencies".
- This can be a bit overwhelming.
- Don't avoid updating your R and all the packages.
- Embrace the quirkiness :-)

## What can you expect?
<div class="columns-2">
  ![](pics/programming_learning_curve.jpg)

- Sorry, you can't learn to code in 2 days.
- **But** you will acquire the basic skills for the journey ahead.
- Learning is only possible by doing. **No excuses: Start. Using. Code. Now!**
</div>

## Coding is good for you

- Eventually saves time and reduces copy-paste mistakes.
- Key to reproducible science.

## Googling is okay
<div class="columns-2">
  ![](pics/stack_overflow.jpg)

- You don't need to know how to do it - but you need to know where to look.
- We will use Google and the R documentation along the way.
</div>

## Let's dive in!
- They already forked their GitHub repo?
- Open script whatever ...
