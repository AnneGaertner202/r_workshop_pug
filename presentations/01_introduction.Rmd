- R is open source, with tons of additional packages that are developing rapidly.
- Managing your "dependencies" can be a bit overwhelming.
- Don't avoid updating your R and all the packages.
- Embrace the quirkiness :-)

## What can you expect?

  ![](pics/programming_learning_curve.jpg)

- Sorry, you can't learn to code in 2 days.
- **But** you will acquire the basic skills for the journey ahead.
- Learning is only possible by doing. **No excuses: Start. Using. Code. Now!**
</div>

## Coding is good for you

- Eventually saves time and reduces copy-paste mistakes.
- Key to reproducible science.

## Googling is okay
<div class="columns-2">

- You don't need to know how to do it - but you need to know where to look.
- We will use Google and the R documentation along the way.
</div>

## Let's dive in!
- They already forked their GitHub repo?
- Open script whatever ...
